              microscopes encumber research. We developed a method that reduces
              data size and processing time by orders of magnitude while
              disentangling signal by taking advantage of the laminar structure
              of many biological specimens. Our Image Surface Analysis
              Environment automatically constructs an atlas of 2D images for
              arbitrarily shaped, dynamic and possibly multilayered surfaces of
              interest. Built-in correction for cartographic distortion ensures
              that no information on the surface is lost, making the method
              suitable for quantitative analysis. We applied our approach to 4D
              imaging of a range of samples, including a Drosophila
              melanogaster embryo and a Danio rerio beating heart.",

              workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting
              and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by
              interactively providing sparse training annotations for a
              nonlinear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five
              dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational
              back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing
              for interactive prediction on data larger than RAM. Once the
              classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new
              data from the command line without further user interaction. We
              describe all ilastik workflows in detail, including three case
              studies and a discussion on the expected performance.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Many animal embryos pull and close an epithelial sheet
               around the ellipsoidal egg surface during a gastrulation process
               known as epiboly. The ovoidal geometry dictates that the
               epithelial sheet first expands and subsequently compacts.
               Moreover, the spreading epithelium is mechanically stressed and
               this stress needs to be released. Here we show that during
               extraembryonic tissue (serosa) epiboly in the insect Tribolium
               castaneum, the non-proliferative serosa becomes regionalized
               into a solid-like dorsal region with larger non-rearranging
               cells, and a more fluid-like ventral region surrounding the
               leading edge with smaller cells undergoing intercalations. Our
               results suggest that a heterogeneous actomyosin cable
               contributes to the fluidization of the leading edge by driving
               sequential eviction and intercalation of individual cells away
               from the serosa margin. Since this developmental solution
               utilized during epiboly resembles the mechanism of wound
               healing, we propose actomyosin cable-driven local tissue
               fluidization as a conserved morphogenetic module for closure of
               epithelial gaps.",
